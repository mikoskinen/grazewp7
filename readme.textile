h1. GrazeWP7

GrazeWP7 is a Windows Phone 7 app marketing site generator. It uses the "Graze templating engine":https://github.com/mikoskinen/graze with "Twitter Bootstrap.":https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/

GrazeWP7 uses a simple configuration file to generate a static web site for your application. The generated site is pure HTML / CSS / JavaScript and can be hosted on any web server.

h2. Quick start

# Download the "zip-package":https://github.com/downloads/mikoskinen/grazewp7/grazewp7.zip *or* clone this repository.
# Add your application's screenshots to folder template\assets\shots.
# Customize the template\configuration.xml -file.
# Run graze.exe.

The static site (index.html) is generated into the output folder. The site can be hosted on any web server.

h3. The template

The GrazeWP7 template uses the Graze templating engine. The template is created using the Razor syntax and is located in template\index.cshtml.

h3. The configuration file

The GrazeWP7 configuration file contains the data for your web site. First three lines contain the basic information about your app:

<pre>
<code>
  <Title>My App Name</Title>
  <Description>Wonderful application!</Description>
  <ApplicationId></ApplicationId>
</code>
</pre>

Then you have couple taglines to fill:

<pre>
<code>
  <Subtitle>Another tagline goes here!</Subtitle>
  <ReviewsTitle>See what others are saying.</ReviewsTitle>
</code>
</pre>

Next up are the reviews. You can add freely customize the quantity, but don't delete the Reviews-tag:

<pre>
<code>
  <Reviews>
    <Review author="Miquel" rating="5">Wonderful application, love it greatly!</Review>
    <Review author="Miquel" rating="4">Wonderful application, love it greatly!</Review>
    <Review author="Miquel" rating="5">Wonderful application, love it greatly!</Review>
  </Reviews>
</code>
</pre>

The screenshots are defined in the configuration file. These images are shown from the template\assets\shots -folder. Same as with the reviews, the quantity is not fixed:

<pre>
<code>
  <Screenshots>
    <screenshot alt="History view">screenshot1.png</screenshot>
    <screenshot alt="Home view">screenshot2.png</screenshot>
    <screenshot alt="Estimate view">screenshot3.png</screenshot>
    <screenshot alt="Estimate view">screenshot4.png</screenshot>
  </Screenshots>
</code>
</pre>

Last list in the configuration contains the features:

<pre>
<code>

  </Features>

</pre>
